    <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have
        a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with
        laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights,
        or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">
        <strong><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></strong>
    </h3>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mt-2">
        <li>
            <strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably
            necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests
            and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the
            purposes described in order to:

            we are involved.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the

            of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
        </li>
        <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to
            the production of records
        </li>
        <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the
            collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
        </li>
        <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>

    <h2 id="international" class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">7. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your
        own.
    </p>
    <p>Our servers are located in Spain. If you are accessing our Services from outside Spain, please be aware that your
        information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with
        whom we may share your personal information (see "<a href="#share-info">WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR

    <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not
        necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However,
        we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice
        and applicable law.</p>

    <h2 id="retain-info" class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

        <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
        this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
        privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
        other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
        longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
        further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h2 id="keep-info-safe" class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
        technical security measures.
    </p>
    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
        the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
        be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
        environment.</p>

        represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
        minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of

        non-marketing purposes.</p>

    <p>You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we
        will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law,
        such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance
        requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against
        illegal activities.</p>

    <h5 class="font-bold mt-2"><u>Right to be informed — Request to know</u></h5>

    <p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>

    <h5 class="font-bold mt-2"><u>Verification process</u></h5>
    <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom
        we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information
        so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
        request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you
        provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method
        (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as
        the circumstances dictate.</p>
    <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the
        request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
        verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
        request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
        fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.</p>

        <li>You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request

            behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
        </li>
        <li>You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving
            an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen
